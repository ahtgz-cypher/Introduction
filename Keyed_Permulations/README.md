# Challenge: What is the mathematical term for a one-to-one corespondence?
Use the same key, the permulation can be performed in reverse, mapping the output block back to the orginal input block=. It is important that there is a one-to-one corespondence between input and output blocks, otherwise we would be able to rely on the ciphertext to decrypt back to the same plaintext we started with 
# Solution: The answer is bijection
